# jepsen easy

A demo repo of Jepsen from [this blog post](https://medium.com/@arpith/writing-your-first-jepsen-test-ddcfee61a409 "original blog post for this repo"), so that you can clone and run.

I created it in order to provide people with "instant gratification",
but more importantly because Jepsen updated certain internal
namespaces, in particular `jepsen.generator`. So in order to save time
for those who are reading the blog post and avoind and head scratching
of "Why doesn't this work?" moments, you can use this.

## Usage

Read [this blog post](https://medium.com/@arpith/writing-your-first-jepsen-test-ddcfee61a409 "original blog post for this repo"), then use this repo to run it.

Obviously that blog post was written in 2016, so to make it easy:

you need to have Docker & Docker Compose installed.

With that, the rest of the steps should be straightforward.
